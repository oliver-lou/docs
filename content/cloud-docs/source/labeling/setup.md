### Labeling Connection Settings

1. Write a name for your connection in Vanus Connect.

2. Insert the following:

- **Source Path:** A Source path refers to JSON path origin.
- **Target Path:** A Target path refers JSON path where the output is placed. The output is a list of labels.
    
**Example of a Path**

A JSON path would be structured in this format; `$.data.body.title`

In this example, the JSON path specifies the location of the title attribute within the body object of a CloudEvent's data attribute. The path consists of several components, separated by the dot (.) operator:

- `$`: The root object of the JSON document.
- `data`: The key of a property within the root object.
- `body`: The key of a property within the data object.
- `title`: The key of a property within the body object.
By following this path, you can access the value of the title attribute within the body object of a CloudEvent's data attribute.

- Label: The configuration of a label, example below:
```json
{
    "label1": {
        "keys": ["key1", "key2"]
    },
    "label2": {
        "keys": ["key3", "key4", "key5"]
    }
}
```
If "key1" or "key2" is present in the value of  the `Source Path`, the `Target Path` will have the "label1".
If "key3" or "key4" or "key5" is present in the value of the `Source Path`, the `Target Path` will have the "label2".
