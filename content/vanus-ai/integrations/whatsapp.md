### Step 3: Utilizing Your AI on WhatsApp
The AI you've crafted is applicable on WhatsApp through an Android device, an iOS device, WhatsApp Web, and WhatsApp Desktop. In essence, your account now operates as the AI, automatically responding to messages from your contacts. Nevertheless, this setup isn't intended for personal AI usage.
