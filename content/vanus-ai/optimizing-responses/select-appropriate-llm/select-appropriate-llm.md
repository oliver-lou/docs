## Differences between ChatGPT 3.5, Azure GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4
ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT-4 are large language models developed by OpenAI, but they differ in terms of functionality and capacity:

| Model | Description | Advantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ChatGPT 3.5** | A versatile model capable of answering questions, engaging in deep discussions, drafting emails, writing code, and generating written content. | Its training involves reinforcement learning from human feedback, enabling it to adapt and respond more specifically to dialogue context. |
| **Azure GPT-3.5** | Essentially identical to ChatGPT-3.5, but offered through the Azure platform. | / |
| **ChatGPT-4** | OpenAI's most advanced system, capable of producing safer and more useful responses. | GPT-4 scores higher among testers than ChatGPT 3.5. It can tackle harder problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem-solving capabilities. Creatively, GPT-4 is more inventive and collaborative than ever. When handling long texts, GPT-4 can manage texts with over 25,000 words, making it suitable for creating long-form content, extending conversations, and document search and analysis. |


### 1. Capability Differences: 
GPT-4, the latest and most advanced large language model from OpenAI, boasts a wider range of general knowledge and stronger problem-solving abilities than ChatGPT 3.5, while capable of answering questions and generating content, falls short when it comes to complex queries and extensive content.

### 2. Innovation: 
GPT-4 excels in the realm of innovation, demonstrating a superior ability to understand and generate innovative content, such as storytelling or code writing. In comparison, ChatGPT 3.5 may not match GPT-4's performance in this area.

### 3. Handling Long Texts: 
GPT-4 can process texts exceeding 25,000 words, making it suitable for creating long-form content, extending conversations, and conducting document search and analysis. On the other hand, ChatGPT 3.5 might face constraints when dealing with lengthy content.

While the cost in message credits for ChatGPT-4 is higher, it can produce more accurate and context-aware responses, [Pricing- Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.vanus.ai/pricing/) can address your queries.

:::note
**If you need high-quality responses, the ChatGPT-4 model is recommended.** This model excels in language skills, knowledge capacity, reasoning abilities, and understanding.
