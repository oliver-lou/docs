# Optimizing Your Prompt
## What is Basic Prompt?
A prompt is used to **initiate** a Large Language Model and **guide** it to generate text of a specific type or style. These prompts can be a word, a sentence, or even a dialogue. In the case of conversational robots, the prompts are usually the **user's questions or requests**.

When we provide a prompt to the robot, it generates a response based on this prompt. This response is based on the patterns the robot learned during the training process and its understanding of the prompt. 

Therefore, prompts are a key part of the robot's understanding and responding to user requests. It helps the robot **understand** the user's needs and **generate** appropriate responses. 

## How to create a good prompt?
**Different Large Language Models may have different tricks** for creating prompts, and it is recommended that you test different prompts with the model you choose to find the best way to create prompts. 

### Basic Guidelines for Creating Prompts
Here are some basic guidelines for creating prompts:

**1. Define your Goal**

Clearly articulate what you want from the model's response. This helps in shaping your prompt.

**2. Be Specific**

Large language models respond to the specifics of a prompt. If you are **vague or ambiguous**, the model may not return the desired results.

**3. Contextual Clues**

Provide as much **relevant context** as possible within your prompt. The context helps the model generate more accurate and relevant responses.

**4. Directness**

You may need to be **more direct than you would with a human**. For example, instead of asking "Can you tell me...?", you might say, "**Describe in detail...**".

**5. Experiment**

Different prompts can lead to different outputs, so **experimentation is key**. Try **rewriting the prompt in different ways** if the output is not what you expected.

**6. Review and Refine** 

**Based on** the responses you receive, you can **refine your prompts** to better achieve the desired outcomes.

### Less Effective Prompt VS Better Prompt

For the above seven guidelines, examples of less effective prompts and better prompts are provided here.

| Consideration         | Less Effective Prompt                   | Better Prompt                                                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Define your Goal**  | *Tell me something.*                    | Provide a summary of the book "1984" by George Orwell.           |
| **Be Specific**       | *What's the weather?*                   | What's the weather like in New York City right now?              |
| **Contextual Clues**  | *Translate this.*                       | Translate the phrase "I love you" from English to French.        |
| **Directness**        | *Can you tell me about photosynthesis?* | Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants.                |
| **Experiment**        | *Write a poem.*                         | Write a poem in the style of Robert Frost about winter.          |
| **Review and Refine** | *Tell me about World War II.*           | Provide a detailed timeline of major events during World War II. |

### Tips for Applying Guidelines

Remember, these suggestions indeed share some **overlap**, but they each **emphasize a particular aspect** of designing effective prompts to guide and optimize the model's output. When creating prompts for your AI application, you can **check for yourself** whether these seven guidelines have been met.

|      Suggestion       |                         Key Aspect                          |
|:---------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Define your Goal**  |                Tell the model what you want.                |
|    **Be Specific**    | Emphasizes the need for detail and precision in the prompt. |
| **Contextual Clues**  |              Give more background information.              |
|    **Directness**     |         Make the request clear and straightforward.         |
|    **Experiment**     |                Try different ways of asking.                |
| **Review and Refine** |       Improve prompts based on the model's responses.       |


In practice, these considerations often **work together** to help you craft better prompts.
