# Amazon RDS MySQL

This guide contains the required information to set up an Amazon MySQL Sink in Vanus Connect.

## Introduction  

MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system to store, organizes, and retrieves data for websites, applications, and other software.

Vanus Connect's AWS MySQL sink connector simplifies transferring data/events from various sources to a MySQL database/table, with configurable filters and upsert/insert modes.

## Prerequisites

Before forwarding events to MySQL, you must have:

- An [**Amazon Web Services**](https://aws.amazon.com) account.
- A [**Vanus Cloud Account**](https://cloud.vanus.ai).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up a MySQL Server in AWS Using RDS

1. Log in to the [**AWS Management Console**](https://aws.amazon.com/) using your root account credentials.

2. Type **RDS**① in the search box and select **RDS**② from the results.

## Custom Connection

The event data must be in JSON format and created following the structure of your database, here's an example:

{
  "title": "value",
  "date": "value",
  "ect...": "value"
}
```
