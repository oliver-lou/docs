# SAP BTP

This guide contains information to set up a SAP BTP Source in Vanus Connect.

## Introduction

SAP BTP, short for SAP Business Technology Platform, is a comprehensive platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that enables organizations to build, integrate, and extend their business applications and processes in a cloud-based environment. SAP BTP offers a range of services and tools that empower businesses to develop and deploy innovative applications, connect to various data sources, and leverage advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and Internet of Things (IoT).

The SAP BTP Source is a webhook server that enables you to establish an endpoint for receiving events from your SAP BTP application. To achieve this, it is necessary to establish a connection within SAP BTP.
